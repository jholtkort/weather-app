# Weather App

## This app uses React and axios, and fetches weather data from the Open Weather Map API to display to the user. I will conditionally render the background, depending on the type of weather received from the API.

### To use:

    -   Enter your zip code into the text input box
    -   Click the submit button, or hit return on your keyboard
    -   Weather data will be displayed below
